----------

Welcome to my website!

I'm a second-year Computer Science student studying at Durham University.

Here are some of my projects!

##Projects

### [NoteWize - A-Level Computer Science Project](https://github.com/Kacper-Lubisz/A-Level-Project)
Though old, this is the project that I am most proud of.
The project was a program which using machine learning transcribed the sound of played
guitar into guitar tablature.  
The project involved everything from Fourier transforms, convolution networks to search tree optimisation.  

### [p5.js project - Comp. Sci. First Year](https://github.com/Kacper-Lubisz/L1-1st-Project)
This is one of my more creative and artistic projects.
The task of the assignment was to improve an already existing artistic p5.js project, which I certainly achieved.

### [TCP Message Board - Comp. Sci. Second Year](https://github.com/Kacper-Lubisz/TCP-Message-Board)
This was a second-year summative assignment.
This is the most recent project that I have that I can show off.
